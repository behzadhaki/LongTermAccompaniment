# 1 [DONE] - For first N epochs, only update the encoder and not the decoder components. To ensure that the encoder is learning the groove of the instrumental
# 2 - On the decoder input, don't provide velocity, only hits and offsets <- now set to zero but should be removed entirely for reducing complexity and error

# 3 - instead of providing shifted version to decoder, provide the shifted groove of instrumental





# 1 - Use next timestep prediction instead of next bar prediction

# 2 - Use teacher forcing to train the model --> not so helpful (super slow training)
