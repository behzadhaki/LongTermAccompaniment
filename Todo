# 1. LTA with changing context prediction
# 2. LTA dataset w/ Melody Contour
# 3. Do self-similarity analysis (and control the contributions accordingly)


# Divide data by similarity rates (look at last cell of notebook). Then, find the count of samples in each bucket,
then weight losses accordingly.
